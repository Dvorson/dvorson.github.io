# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post. This is a sample post to test the publishing workflow and rendering capabilities of this site.

## Features Tested

This post demonstrates various Markdown formatting options supported by the blog:

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, or ***bold and italic*** text. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ if needed.

### Lists

Here's an unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3 with *formatting*

And an ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step with **bold text**

### Code Blocks

Here's some inline code: `const greeting = "Hello!";`

And a code block:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  return true;
}
```
